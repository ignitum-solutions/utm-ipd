## What’s the Universal Trust Model?

UTM is a **five-parameter, continuous trust meter**:

`T_new = T_old + α · (result – T_old)`

It **rises** when an interaction is favourable and **falls** (asymmetrically)
when it is harmful.  
Because UTM is **domain-agnostic** and differentiable, it can power everything
from simple repeated games to large-scale multi-agent simulations.

## Quick start (Docker, 30 s)

```bash
docker build -t utm-ipd .
docker run --rm -p 8501:8501 utm-ipd
# open http://localhost:8501
```

_(If you publish to ECR or GHCR, replace the first line with
`docker pull public.ecr.aws/…/utm-ipd:latest` and run the same command.)_

## Developer setup (Poetry)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ignitum-solutions/utm-ipd.git
cd utm-ipd
poetry install
poetry run streamlit run dash/app.py       # or any page in dash/
```
